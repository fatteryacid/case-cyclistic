# Case Study: Cyclistic

Hey there, glad you stopped by!

My name is Tyler, and this is my case study for a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic.

In this case study, I use historical data from Divvy to identify key differences between casual bike-share users and annual membership owners.

With the insights in hand, I then offer recommendations for Cyclistic's marketing efforts.

Well, that's enough from me. Please feel free to take a look around. Hope you enjoy your stay!
